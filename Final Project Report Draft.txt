Second research phase



Implementation phase Challenges:
- Data collection
	- 
- Data 
- Running time
	- the  
- normalization and standardization 
	- letters were of different sizes and so were the images,
	- we had used the standardization function of the CNN as we implemented in Project 5, however, that did not help.
