Collected Data



Going to try running CNN on the Data we collected 
- Dividing testing versus training pile
- Waiting on Diana's Qs
- Finished wiht 26 classes, got rid of 13 of them to fit the 15 classes limit 
- Ran CNN which returned around 3% accuracy

* Next step: have Diana look at the code and add more image processes before running thru CNN agian.   

Update:
- Diana has looked at image processing, has implemented it correctly :)
- Code runs, and is likely overfitting, as training accuracy is extremely high, while testing is very low
- Probably honestly need to collect more data
- Could look into seeing how we might take the corresponding letter for just one image and output to a text file,
  just so we have the beginnings of how a more well-developed program would work??
