Collected Data



Going to try running CNN on the Data we collected 
- Dividing testing versus training pile
- Waiting on Diana's Qs
- Finished wiht 26 classes, got rid of 13 of them to fit the 15 classes limit 
- Ran CNN which returned around 3% accuracy

* Next step: have Diana look at the code and add more image processes before running thru CNN agian.   

Update May 8th :
- Diana has looked at image processing, has implemented it correctly :)
- Code runs, and is likely overfitting, as training accuracy is extremely high, while testing is very low
- Probably honestly need to collect more data
  - Diana uploaded a folder called "batch3" into the Final Project Data folder. Didn't have time to sort it out 
    into the different folders yet, but it is at least uploaded all in that one folder.   
	  - Francis sorted the new batch3 data into different folders and was amazed at how much data 	was added! Also going to add those data into training & testing files 

  - There are also some screenshots of words that I didn't know what to do with for one reason or another, we can discuss later
  - Also I was naming some of the characters based on what they're short for, and didn't realize until later there are two shorthands for "um"??? This is unfortunate :(
	- Francis: perhaps we should start to sort letters by their appearance 
- Could look into seeing how we might take the corresponding letter for just one image and output to a text file,
  just so we have the beginnings of how a more well-developed program would work??
